# On Snowflake, quoting is set to false by default. 
# Whereas most databases will lowercase unquoted identifiers, 
# Snowflake will uppercase unquoted identifiers.
# If a model name is lowercased and quoted, then it cannot be referred to without quotes
# We can override at granular level as needed.
